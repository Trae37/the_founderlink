## CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES (Alex Hormozi Framework)

### 1. **Clear Problem Recognition**
The headline immediately identifies the pain point: hiring is slow, risky, and confusing for non-technical founders.

### 2. **Specific Mechanism**
The subheadline and toolkit contents explain the exact system (7-day sprint, step-by-step process, specific days with specific outcomes).

### 3. **Believability**
Social proof, risk reversal, and the specificity of the toolkit build credibility. Founders see this is real, actionable, and low-risk.

### 4. **Urgency & Scarcity (Subtle)**
The emphasis on "launch outreach in under 24 hours" and "the best developers get snatched up fast" creates mild urgency without being pushy.

### 5. **Clear CTA**
The button text is specific and action-oriented: "Download the 7-Day Hiring Sprint Toolkit" (not vague like "Learn More").

### 6. **Friction Reduction**
The risk reversal ("no spam, unsubscribe anytime") removes hesitation. Email capture is the only ask—no payment, no long form.
